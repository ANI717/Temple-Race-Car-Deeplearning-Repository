We are developing an End-to-end Learning Architecture for Autonomous Driving with Regression Model Approach. The End-to-end Learning Architecture contains a stack of Convolutional Layers for Preprocessing and Feature Extraction from Images, followed by Fully Connected Layers on top. The whole architecture is defined as Convolutional Nueral Networks or ConvNets (CNN) in concurrent literatures.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
=======
## Database
* data/images/
```
Contains raw images collected in different environments and time period. 
The image repository remains immutable during whole session.
```
* data/lists/
```
Contanis CSV files with lists of image directories for deep learning session. 
Contains randomly shuffled image set along with 5 fold cross validation set for deep learning sessions.
